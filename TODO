TODO
1. two modes: one for consecutive indexes, the other is default
2. when close the file clean all the record* stored in the list

1. test the destructor of Record

1. in File.cc :  GetFirst(Record*)  change to use Consume() and check all the calls to this GetFirst()
   also can we eliminate Record.Reuse() since if we use Consume() everywhere like in Pipe.Insert() then no need to set bits to null manually like in SelectFile.workFunc()
2. in SortedDBFile: rename tempfile and remove oldfile
3. unify the way we use the parameters   pointer or reference    and for the temp var we use outside  pointer or object
