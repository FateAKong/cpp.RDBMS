TO IMPLEMENT

P3
 - project & groupBy have output columns adjusting yet (needed or not?)
 - 


P2
 - improve binding between BigQ runLength and Use_N_Page()
 - update comparing functions invoked by GetNext(cnf) in sorted version
 - inheritance structure of DBFile
 - double buffering and other optimization for external sorting 
   profiling and comparison among different external sort methods
 - rename tempfile and remove oldfile
 
P1
 - use Consume() model (as much as possible) and if not applicable use Reuse()
   check all the calls to this GetFirst() to make sure the model is unified
   as well adjust the way of destructor
 - unify the way of parameters (pointer or reference?)
   also unify the way of temp var outside  (pointer or object?)
 - two modes: one for consecutive indexes, the other is default?

TO TEST

P2
 - load() inherited generic class
 - add() branch of merging
 - getNext(cnf) needs more paths cover
 - when close the file clean all the record* stored in the list
